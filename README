Jenkins Console Line Number plugin

A Jenkins build wrapper plugin that, when activated for your project, will add html linkable line
numbers to the job console output.

Each line is linkable via the an "#nnn" suffix on the "consoleFull" link for any
job.   For example, to send someone a link to the 150th line of your "MyBuild" run number 10, you can send them the URL:
http://myjenkins.server.com/job/MyBuild/10/consoleFull#150
